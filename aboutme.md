Hello fellow reader, welcome to my weblog. My name is Rihards Kubilis, I am linux enthusiast, interested in web related technologies, mobile application development and still learning… As in statement by Jiddu Krishnamurti “There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning.” This blog is my attempt to reflect on my findings during journey of continuous growth and self-development.
