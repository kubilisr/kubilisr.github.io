Quick shout-out about free scala resources compiled together under this link [https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#scala](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#scala){:target="_blank"}. There are many other resources related to other programming languages and technical topics.

Especially I want to highlight [http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/){:target="_blank"} which I would like to go through and make a series of posts about my progress.
