... so I was recently revisiting websites related to UNIX-like operation systems that contain information about various BSD 	OS-es,
what cought my attention is that I have almost forgotten that [NetBSD project](https://www.netbsd.org/about/){:target="_blank"} has this screaming motto "Of course it runs NetBSD", but not without reason ;) . NetBSD has a well-deserved reputation for portability.  
It got me inspired, and I thought what 
if I could use this approach ( ok, not exactly same approach, but more or less related to portability )
to boost my recent effort to learn [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org){:target="_blank"} programming language.
I am mostly interested in android application development and it would be interesting to see how hard ( ... or easy or whatever ... ) it could be to rewrite,
some of the android applications with freely available source code that are written in other programming languages i.e. Java, using Kotlin.  
For starters I could rewrite sample applications provided by [http://developer.android.com/](http://developer.android.com/){:target="_blank"}, in my opinion in this way I could better understand existing applications and get experience in logic involved underneath Kotlin in order to get same functionality or at least close to it. 
And in the end my imagination produced such slogan "Of course it can be written in Kotlin" - shameless derivation of NetBSD's moto 8-) .
